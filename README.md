# Polar Signals workshops 

This workshop is designed for software engineers who want to learn how to profile their applications written in Go, Python, Rust, C, and C++. 
Profiling helps you identify performance bottlenecks in your code and writing benchmarks helps optimizes its execution.

Each language will have a dedicated lab where you'll profile a sample application and analyze the results.

## Prerequisites

* Basic understanding of your chosen programming language (Go, Python, Rust, C, or C++)
* Familiarity with your operating system's command line
* A Linux VM, preferrably Ubuntu

### Linux VM with lima on macOS

For macOS users are recommended to use [lima](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima) to run a Linux VM. 
To get started use `brew install lima` followed by `limactl start`. Once finished access the VM by running `lima`.
